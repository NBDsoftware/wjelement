This project has been modified by us in order to add some features, like an enhaced error printing.

This is a cmake project. It has not been configured as an eclipse project yet, so you will need to install cmake 
in order to compile it. 

You can compile it using the instructions in the INSTALL file, but I advice instead to do it using the standard 
procedure when working with cmake: navigate to the root directory of the project and run:

* if CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH is not provided, by default it will be /usr/local, then you need to install with 'sudo make install'
* To compile as a static library just provide '-DSTATIC_LIB=yes' to cmake. By default it's OFF(no), therefore the library will be compiled as a dynamic lib.

$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/path/here -DSTATIC_LIB=yes
$make -j 4
$make install

Both procedures should work fine.

To compile in Marenostrum IV, you will need to pass the following optimization
flags to cmake (though you can probably skip them, since this library does not probably
represent a bottleneck):

$ CFLAGS="-mtune=skylake -xCORE-AVX512 -m64 -fPIC" cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/path/here -DSTATIC_LIB=yes


 

In development environments this library can be used as a DLL, but in the clusters it has to be linked
statically, since we do not install it in a location where the linker can find it at runtime. So in production 
environments this has to be a static library. You can switch between the two modes of compilation setting the 
variable PRODUCTION in the main CMakeList file.  

This library is not installed automatically with the PELE installation script. You have to upload manually the code to 
the cluster, compile it there and then move the header and the .a files to locations pointed by the computersConfiguration.py script 
(in the PELE repository, this script can be found at /PELE-1.5/scripts/Production/BuildTools).

When executing make install in not production mode -that is, your local machine-, it should install the library
 in the directory of your election (by default /usr/local). However, in production mode it won't install the 
 compiled libraries.
